# Swapnils-Personalised-Real-Estate-Agent-Udacity-Compatible
This is a project for Udacity's Nanodegree Program on AI/ML..... (Compatible with Udacity's ChromaDB)

Goal: Build a “Real Estate Agent” application that uses LLMs for content generation, vector databases, semantic search, and RAG techniques to transform standard real estate listings into personalized narratives.

Core Tasks

To pass this project, learners must complete the following:

1. Generate synthetic data using LLMs
2. Embed property listing data in a vector database
3. Perform semantic search over property listings based on user preferences
4. Design prompts and apply RAG techniques to deliver personalized recommendations

Quick Description of My Work:

Step 0 - Makesure the versions of all libraries are from Udacity's Nanodegree AI/ML Workspace

Step 1 - Generated Listings using OpenAI Model: gpt-3.5-turbo (library version - 0.28.1)

Step 2 - Embedding done on Chroma DB using OpenAIEmbeddings

Step 3 - Semantic Search was performed using Chroma from Langchain

Step 4 - RAG using RetreivalQA from langchain.chains performed to keep things simple yet effective enough

Step 5 - Personalization using ConversationSummaryMemory

Warning: There are huge chances of version mismatch so lookout for it...

Hope it Helps !!!
